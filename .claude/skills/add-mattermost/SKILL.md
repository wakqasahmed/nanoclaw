# Add Mattermost Channel

This skill adds Mattermost support to NanoClaw using the skills engine for deterministic code changes, then walks through interactive setup.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight

### Check if already applied

Read `.nanoclaw/state.yaml`. If `mattermost` is in `applied_skills`, skip to Phase 3 (Setup). The code changes are already in place.

### Ask the user

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect configuration:

AskUserQuestion: Should Mattermost replace all other channels or run alongside them?
- **Replace** - Mattermost will be the only channel
- **Alongside** - Both Mattermost and other channels active

AskUserQuestion: Do you have a Mattermost bot token, or do you need to create one?

If they have one, collect it now. If not, we'll create one in Phase 3.

## Phase 2: Apply Code Changes

Run the skills engine to apply this skill's code package. The package files are in this directory alongside this SKILL.md.

### Initialize skills system (if needed)

If `.nanoclaw/` directory doesn't exist yet:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts --init
```

Or call `initSkillsSystem()` from `skills-engine/migrate.ts`.

### Apply the skill

```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-skill.ts .claude/skills/add-mattermost
```

This deterministically:
- Adds `src/channels/mattermost.ts` (MattermostChannel class using the channel registry pattern)
- Adds `src/channels/mattermost.test.ts` (unit tests with mock fetch)
- Three-way merges `import './mattermost.js'` into `src/channels/index.ts` (barrel import for self-registration)
- Updates `.env.example` with `MATTERMOST_URL` and `MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN`
- Records the application in `.nanoclaw/state.yaml`

If the apply reports merge conflicts, read the intent file:
- `modify/src/channels/index.ts.intent.md` — what changed for the barrel import

### Validate code changes

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

All tests must pass (including the new Mattermost tests) and build must be clean before proceeding.

## Phase 3: Setup

### Create Mattermost Bot (if needed)

If the user doesn't have a bot token, tell them:

> I need you to create a Mattermost bot:
>
> 1. Log in to your Mattermost instance as an admin
> 2. Go to **System Console** → **Integrations** → **Bot Accounts**
> 3. Enable Bot Account Creation if not already enabled
> 4. Go to **Integrations** → **Bot Accounts** → **Add Bot Account**
> 5. Fill in the details:
>    - Username: e.g., "andy-assistant"
>    - Display Name: e.g., "Andy Assistant"
> 6. Click **Create Bot Account**
> 7. After creation, click **Edit** next to the bot
> 8. Enable **Allow this bot to post to all channels**
> 9. Copy the **Token**

Wait for the user to provide the URL and token.

### Configure environment

Add to `.env`:

```bash
MATTERMOST_URL=https://your-mattermost-instance.com
MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
```

Sync to container environment:

```bash
mkdir -p data/env && cp .env data/env/env
```

The container reads environment from `data/env/env`, not `.env` directly.

### Build and restart

```bash
npm run build
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw  # macOS
# Linux: systemctl --user restart nanoclaw
```

## Phase 4: Registration

### Get Channel ID

Tell the user:

> To get the channel ID for registration:
>
> 1. In Mattermost, go to the channel you want to register
> 2. Click the channel name at the top → **View Info**
> 3. The Channel ID is shown at the bottom (a 26-character alphanumeric string)
>
> The JID format for NanoClaw is: `mm:<channel-id>`

Wait for the user to provide the channel ID.

### Register the channel

Use the IPC register flow or register directly. The channel ID, name, and folder name are needed.

For a main channel (responds to all messages, uses the `main` folder):

```typescript
registerGroup("mm:<channel-id>", {
  name: "<channel-name>",
  folder: "main",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: false,
});
```

For additional channels (trigger-only):

```typescript
registerGroup("mm:<channel-id>", {
  name: "<channel-name>",
  folder: "<folder-name>",
  trigger: `@${ASSISTANT_NAME}`,
  added_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  requiresTrigger: true,
});
```

## Phase 5: Verify

### Test the connection

Tell the user:

> Send a message in your registered Mattermost channel:
> - For main channel: Any message works
> - For non-main: `@<assistant-name> hello` (using the configured trigger word)
>
> The bot should respond within a few seconds.

### Check logs if needed

```bash
tail -f logs/nanoclaw.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding

1. Check `MATTERMOST_URL` and `MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN` are set in `.env` AND synced to `data/env/env`
2. Check channel is registered: `sqlite3 store/messages.db "SELECT * FROM registered_groups WHERE jid LIKE 'mm:%'"`
3. For non-main channels: message must include trigger pattern
4. Service is running: `launchctl list | grep nanoclaw` (macOS) or `systemctl --user status nanoclaw` (Linux)

### Bot connected but not receiving messages

1. Verify the bot has been added to the channel
2. Verify the bot has permission to read messages in the channel
3. Check that the bot account is enabled in System Console

### Getting Channel ID

The channel ID can also be found:
- Using Mattermost API: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN" $MATTERMOST_URL/api/v4/channels | jq '.[] | {id, display_name, name}'`
- In the channel header click menu → "View Info"

## After Setup

The Mattermost channel supports:
- **Public channels** — Bot must be added to the channel
- **Private channels** — Bot must be invited to the channel
- **Direct messages** — Users can DM the bot directly
- **Multi-channel** — Runs alongside all other configured channels

## Known Limitations

- **No real-time websocket** — Uses polling (every 2 seconds) for new messages. A future version could add websocket support.
- **No typing indicator** — Mattermost's bot API doesn't expose a typing indicator endpoint.
- **No file/image handling** — Only text content is processed.

## Removal

To remove Mattermost integration:

1. Delete `src/channels/mattermost.ts` and `src/channels/mattermost.test.ts`
2. Remove `import './mattermost.js';` from `src/channels/index.ts`
3. Remove Mattermost vars from `.env`
4. Remove Mattermost registrations: `sqlite3 store/messages.db "DELETE FROM registered_groups WHERE jid LIKE 'mm:%'"`
5. Rebuild: `npm run build && launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nanoclaw` (macOS) or `npm run build && systemctl --user restart nanoclaw` (Linux)
